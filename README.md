# Project Title

Short one-line description of what your project does and why it matters.

## Overview

This project aims to:
- Develop a deep learning model which can classify different beats and rhythms of ECG into different classes
- Test the model using ESP32 data and ECG sensor AD8232 for real-time classification
- Create a web application to visualize the ECG signal and different feautures (classification, heart rate, etc)

## Features

- Feature 1 (e.g., Data preprocessing and model deployement)
- Feature 2 (e.g., Real-time data acquisition from ESP32)
- Feature 3 (e.g., Signal preprocessing and noise filtering)
- Feature 4 (e.g., CNN-based classification)
- Feature 5 (e.g., Visualization with web app)
